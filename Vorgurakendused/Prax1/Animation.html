        <p>You've got a fast car,
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero we've got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I've got nothing to prove

You've got a fast car
I've got a plan to get us out of here
Been working down the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far,
Just cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living.

You see my old man's got a problem
He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say his body's too young to look like this
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did.
