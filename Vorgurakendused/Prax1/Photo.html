            <h2>K2 Black Panther (South Korea)</h2>

            <p>In the mid-1990s, the South Korean government decided to begin developing a domestically designed and produced tank. The result was the Hyundai-built K2 Black Panther which was operational by 2013/14. At first glance, the K2 looks like a Western tank with a large rectangular chassis and turret closely resembling the Leopard 2 and Leclerc. It uses a license-built version of the Leopard 2’s 120mm smoothbore gun as well as a 1500hp German diesel engine. The autoloader is very similar in design and performance to the Leclerc’s and can allow the tank to fire around 10 rounds a minute.The gunner and commander have the newest day/night and thermal sights and in combination with the tank’s battlefield management and command and control systems, makes the K2 one of the most efficient and capable hunter-killer tanks around. Protection is provided by a classified composite armor and additional explosive reactive armor modules. For protection against enemy anti-tank missiles and rockets, the K2 is equipped with an active and passive protection system. The passive system warns of incoming threats and can start jamming and firing off decoys. The active protection system, similar to the Merkava’s ‘Trophy’ system, will attempt to destroy any missiles which are about to hit the tank by using a small explosive charge. Unfortunately, you won’t find any of these features in Hyundai’s latest line of cars and SUVs.</p>

            <h2>T-90AM (Russia)</h2>
            <a href="http://www.therichest.com/rich-list/the-biggest/top-10-most-sophisticated-main-battle-tanks/9/"><img class="alignleft" alt="T-90AM (Russia)" src="images/T-90AM.jpg" style="width: 304px; height: auto"  /></a>
            <p>The Soviet-era T-72 tank was and continues to be the backbone of many tank forces around the world. Over the last few decades the T-72 was upgraded and improved on a regular basis to remain competitive with Western designs. By the mid-1990s, the design had been upgraded so much that Russian designers decided that it warranted a new model – the T-90. For the most part, the T-90 looks like the T-72 but it also incorporates many of the advanced features from the more expensive T-80.In terms of protection, the new tank is superior to the T-72 thanks to a new welded turret and the use of the advanced ‘Relikt’ explosive reactive armor which has been purpose built to stand up to the newest American armor piercing rounds. Additional protection is provided by a laser and missile detection and jamming system which makes it far harder to hit the tank with guided anti-tank missiles. For weaponry, the T-90AM uses an improved version of the 125mm smoothbore cannon found in other Russian/Soviet tanks. The gun uses an autoloader which, in around 6 to 8 seconds, can load a variety of explosive and armor piercing rounds or a highly accurate anti-tank missile</p>

            <h2>M1A2 SEPv2 (USA)</h2>
            <a href="http://www.therichest.com/rich-list/the-biggest/top-10-most-sophisticated-main-battle-tanks/8/"><img class="alignleft" alt="K2 Black Panther" src="images/M1A2-SEPv2.jpg" style="width: 304px; height: auto" ></a>
            <p>Out of all of the tanks on this list, the M1 Abrams is by far the most battle-proven. In service since 1980, the M1 is an older design but constant upgrades have kept it at the top of the list when it comes to ability and sophistication. The M1A2 SEPv2 uses the 120mm smoothbore gun found in many Western tanks and can fire explosive or advanced armor piercing rounds reportedly capable of defeating the most modern armor.

In terms of protection, this tank uses a design based on the British “Chobham” which is made up of layered steel, ceramics, plastic and Kevlar. The M1 goes a step further by adding depleted uranium which is extremely dense and hard to penetrate. The latest Abrams has greatly improved sights, displays and computers for the crew to use. This improvement includes newer thermal viewers for the commander and gunner, modernized GPS system and higher resolution displays. This means the crew can operate with each other and communicate with other friendly units far more efficiently on the battlefield. Additionally, a remote controlled weapons station on the turret means that the commander no longer needs to expose himself to snipers when operating the machine gun.</p>
